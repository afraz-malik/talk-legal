              The Recipient understands and acknowledges that disclosure or
              improper usage of the Confidential Information by the Recipient
              may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party. The Disclosing
              Party's Confidential Information and its ability to reserve it for
              the exclusive knowledge and use of the Disclosing Party is of
              great competitive importance and commercial value to the
              Disclosing Party, in which remedies at law may not be adequate. In
              the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Recipient of
              this Agreement, the Recipient agrees that the Disclosing Party
              shall be entitled to seek, in addition to other potential and/or
              available remedies, a temporary or permanent injunction or other
              equitable relief against such breach or threatened breach from any
              court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of showing
              any actual damages or that monetary damages would not afford an
              adequate remedy. The aforementioned equitable relief shall not be
              in lieu of legal remedies, monetary damages, or other available
              forms of damages or relief.
