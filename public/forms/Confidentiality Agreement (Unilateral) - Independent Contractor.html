        b. The Recipient further understands and acknowledges that this Confidential Information and the Disclosing

        and that improper use or disclosure of the Confidential Information by the Recipient might cause the Disclosing
        Party to incur financial costs

        <br><br>
        c. Confidential Information shall not include information that is generally available to and known by the public

        <br><br>
        d. <u>Permitted disclosures.</u> Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent disclosure of the
        Confidential Information as may be required by
        applicable law or regulation, or pursuant to the valid order of a court or an authorized government agency,
        provided that the disclosure does not exceed
        the extent of disclosure required by such law, regulation, or order. In any case, the Recipient, or its
        Representative, shall promptly provide written
        notice to the Disclosing Party of any such law, regulation, or order.
        <br><br>
        e. <u>Period of Confidentiality Obligations.</u> The Recipient understands and acknowledges that its obligations
        under this Agreement with regard to
        any particular Confidential Information shall commence immediately upon the Effective Date between the Parties

        to such Confidential Information, whichever comes first. Such period shall continue either (i) <u>for three
            (3)</u> years after expiration or termination
        of this Agreement or (ii) until such Confidential Information has become public knowledge other than as a result
        of Recipient’s breach of this
        Agreement.
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <p><b><u>3. Proprietary Rights</u></b></p>

    <p><b><u>4. Degree of Care</u></b></p>
    <p>
        c. The Recipient shall not use Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose other than for
        the Purpose and shall hold in
        strictest confidence such Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Recipient under this
        Agreement.
        The Recipient shall protect and safeguard the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the Disclosing
        Party with
        at least the same degree of care as the Recipient would in protecting its own confidential information, but in
        no event with less
        than a commercially reasonable degree of care, including but not limited to:<br><br>
        i. preventing any disclosure, publication, communication, or otherwise making available Confidential Information
        of the Disclosing Party, or allow it to be disclosed, published, communicated, or made available, in whole or
        part, to any person whatsoever, not having a need to know or authority to know; <br><br>
        ii. using any Confidential Information, except as may be required in connection with the Purpose, or if
        authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party or its authorized Representative; <br><br>
        iii. preventing any access by a third-party, not having a need to know or authority to know; and <br><br>
        iv. preventing the copying of any documents, records, files, media, or other resources that may contain
        Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. <br><br>
        d. The Recipient shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any person other than to its Representatives
        that have a need to know such information in connection with the Purpose and that such Representatives shall be
        informed of this Agreement and shall be directed to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential
        Information.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>5. No License.</u></b></p>
    <p>
        a. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives, Confidential
        Information disclosed hereunder shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. Disclosure of Confidential
        Information to the Disclosing Party shall not constitute any grant, option, or license to the Recipient, under
        any patent, trade secret, or other rights now or hereinafter held by the Disclosing Party, unless expressly
        agreed to in writing by both Parties or their respective Representatives.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>6. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information</u></b></p>
    <p>
        a. At any time during or after the term of this Agreement and at the Disclosing Party's written request, or
        after expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Recipient and shall either destroy all copies all copies,

    <p>
        a. The Recipient understands and acknowledges that disclosure or improper usage of the Confidential Information
        by the Recipient may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party. The Disclosing Party's Confidential
        Information and its ability to reserve it for the exclusive knowledge and use of the Disclosing Party is of
        great competitive importance and commercial value to the Disclosing Party, in which remedies at law may not be
        adequate. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Recipient of this Agreement, the Recipient agrees
        that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek, in addition to other potential and/or available remedies, a
        temporary or permanent injunction or other equitable relief against such breach or threatened breach from any
        court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of showing any actual damages or that monetary damages
        would not afford an adequate remedy. The aforementioned equitable relief shall not be in lieu of legal remedies,
        monetary damages, or other available forms of damages or relief.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>8. No Assignment </u></b></p>
    <p>
        a. No Party may assign this Agreement or any part hereof. Any purported assignment by either Party shall be null

        subsequent breach.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>12. Severability </u></b></p>
    <p>
        a. Should any provision of this Agreement be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be enforceable only if
        modified, or if any portion of this Agreement shall be held unenforceable and stricken, such holding shall not
        affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, the balance of which shall continue to be binding upon
        the Parties with any such modification to become a part hereof and treated as though originally set forth in
        this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>13. Counterparts </u></b></p>
    <p>

        taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart's signature
        page of this Agreement, by facsimile, email in portable document format .pdf, or by any other electronic means,
        such as DocuSign, that is intended to preserve the original graphic appearance of a document, has the same
        effect as delivery of an executed original of this Agreement.
