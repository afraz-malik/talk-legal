                        the Recipient, or its Representative, shall promptly
                        provide written notice to the Disclosing Party of any
                        such law, regulation, or order

                        exclusive knowledge and use of the Disclosing Party is
                        of great competitive importance and commercial value to
                        the Disclosing Party, in which remedies at law may not
                        be adequate. In the event of a breach or threatened

                        potential and/or available remedies, a temporary or
                        permanent injunction or other equitable relief against
                        such breach or threatened breach from any court of
                        competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of showing
                        any actual damages or that monetary damages would not
                        afford an adequate remedy. The aforementioned equitable
                        relief shall not be in lieu of legal remedies, monetary
                        damages, or other available forms of damages or relief.
